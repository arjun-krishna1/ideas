# Ideas
- oPLC
  - Web interface for PLC programming
  - Git version control PLC files
  - access anywhere from git repository
- BoxQA
  - Box
  - Takes pictures all over
  - Generates 3D ,odel
  - Use for quality assurance
- Tebo
  - Robotics software continuous integration platform using simulation unit + regression tests
  - User story
    - Rowan: Autonomous Software lead for UWaterloo self driving car
      - Rowan is the only one on WATO who writes code for our autonomous software division
      - Took him 2 years to get to where he is
      - It takes him 2 weeks after writing the actual autonomous software code to actually be able to test it in simulation
      - Goal is to allow others to create software and to be able to trust its functionallity through unit and regression tests
      - Goal is for him to automatically be able to test his regression and unit tests before merging
  - Bricks:
    - Carla simulation unit testing CI/CD pipeline
      - You write Carla scenarios
      - We test if your code is able to pass them before every merge
      - Used for regression testing robot arms, autonomous cars, etc.
  - Sprinkles
    - Generous free-tier
    - Enterprise tier is $6,000 per month
      - Need for greater than 100 testing scenarios
      - We speed up your tests
      - Parallelize?
    - New UI for low-code, no-code creating Carla testing scenarios
      - Kind of like the Webflow editor
        - Three vertical tabs: visual output, visual editor, code
          - Can edit scenario using visual editor or code
      - Eventually add support for git and version controlling
      - Allows less technical people to help with autonomous software
